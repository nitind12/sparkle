Now get the kids to coat the marbles in different colours and drop them in the box.

                        Pick an outdoor area green area like a park or a garden where you are comfortable sending the kids on their own. Now, leave the kids indoors while you secretly go and pick leaves from different trees/plants/bushes – one leaf for each child. Hand the kids a container with these leaves and let them loose in the green area. The idea is for them to match the leaves they are carrying with those growing on the plants/trees. You can then tell them the name of the plant or tree as well and as much more information as you think can absorb.

                        This is a great activity for teenagers. They can make this on chart paper or on their computers using a template. They can go back as many generations as they want depending on how complex they want the family tree to be. It’s interesting to learn the names and ages and relationships in one’s family – going back to great grandparents, granduncles and aunts. Rummage through old picture and add those too if possible.

                        Give the children a big box and send them off on a scavenger hunt indoors (if you don’t mind your home being turned upside down) or outdoors to a park. Give them a time limit and have them compete against each other if they want. Ask them to collect in the box any items they can find starting with different letters of the alphabet. So your kids may pick up an apple from the kitchen (starts with A), or a safety pin (starts with S) from your sewing box, or a ballpoint pen (starts with B) from your work table. All letters of the alphabet must be covered. And all items must fit in the box provided. The kids can play this in teams with their friends too. A single kid can go on a solo scavenger hunt.

                        This is a lovely way to help out our feathered friends while teaching the kids about different birds in the neighbourhood. Several craft websites will give you tons of ideas about how to make easy, inexpensive bird feeders. And remind the kids to keep refilling it.

                        You don’t need to pull out your recipe books or get into dicing onions to cook a meal with kids. Cooking offers a range of choices – from baking with older kids (a muffin pan, eggs, flour, sugar and a couple of basic recipes you find online to get them started) to teaching the young ones how to butter a slice of bread, roll out chapatis, cut a soft fruit like a banana with a non-sharp knife, whip up some dahi to make raita. Expect a mess at the end of the exercise though!
